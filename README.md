# Automated-SQL-with-LLM

## Natural Language Database Interaction with LLMs
### Objective
This project aims to enable users to interact with a MySQL database using natural language queries. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), users can input plain English questions, which are translated into SQL queries and executed on the backend to retrieve meaningful results.

### Features
#### Natural Language to SQL Translation
Use LLMs to convert user queries into executable SQL.

#### MySQL Database Integration
Seamlessly connect to and interact with a MySQL database.

#### LLM-Powered Query Interpretation
Leverage the power of LLMs (like OpenAI's GPT models) for robust language understanding.

#### Flask Backend
A simple and clean Flask API to manage the query flow between frontend, LLM, and database.

#### Interactive Frontend
A user-friendly interface for entering natural language queries and viewing results.

### Procedure
Set up a MySQL database
Create a local or remote MySQL instance and populate it using the sample data in sql/setup.sql.

### LLM Integration
Use an LLM (e.g., grok API) to convert natural language queries into SQL. Configure the API key and access in llm_module/query_translator.py.

### Develop Flask Backend
The Flask app (backend/app.py) acts as the middleware between the frontend, the LLM, and the database.

### Create Frontend Interface
A simple UI in frontend/index.html lets users enter queries and view results in real-time.
### Requirements
Python 3.8+

Flask

OpenAI Python SDK (if using OpenAI models)

MySQL Server

Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no framework required)
